== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I submit a support request? =

Look at the topics discussed on the [support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-yandex-metrika) tab. You might find the solution there. If the issue with the plugin has not been previously discussed, contact [Support](https://yandex.ru/support/metrica/troubleshooting.html).

= Why is the plugin free? =

This is the official Yandex.Metrica plugin for WordPress. We want to make it as easy as possible for our users to set up Yandex.Metrica and e-commerce, so we made the plugin completely free.

= Is it possible to use two plugins from different developers? =

We recommend using the official Yandex.Metrica plugin separately from other developers' solutions. If you use the official plugin together with third-party modules, it may interfere with the Yandex.Metrica tag.

= What is E-commerce? =

Yandex.Metrica E-commerce is a tool for online store analytics. It provides detailed statistics on sales and interactions with products on a site. [Learn more](https://yandex.ru/promo/metrica/retail)

= How can I check if events are sent correctly without waiting for the data to be displayed in the Yandex.Metrica dashboard? =

Add the ym_debug=1 parameter to the page URL in the browser's address bar and reload the page. Example: http://example.com/?_ym_debug=1
For more information, see [Help](https://yandex.ru/support/metrica/ecommerce/check.html).

= Why does the plugin have separate fields for "Brand type" and "Taxonomy or custom brand field"? =

These fields are needed to correctly send the brand value of the product.
- If you have selected "Term" in the "Brand type" field, then enter the taxonomy name in "Taxonomy or custom brand field".
- If you have selected "Custom field" in the "Brand type" field, then in "Taxonomy or custom brand field", specify the name of the custom field.

= What is Session Replay in the plugin? =

Session Replay technology offers an entirely new level of detail for analyzing the behavior of site users. You can replay their actions exactly as they occurred to see what happens on each page and how users navigate, right down to every mouse movement, keystroke, and click. Enable Session Replay using the checkbox next to the tag field.
